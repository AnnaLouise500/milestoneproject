# "Anna Morrison // Full Stack Developer"

## Why did I create this project?
<ul>
  <li>To enable potential employers and recruiters to see what I can bring to the table. They can see both and online copy and download my CV, read a little about who I am as an individual and contact me if they want to work together.</li>
  <li>I have optimised this project for web browser viewing as I believe my target dynamic would typically view this site on a laptop or a desktop PC. </li>
  <li>I've also connected my GitHub profile to ensure that my target dynamic can view any repositories that I have worked on/am working on. </li>
  <li>I wanted to keep this project simple yet effective so as to not distract from the main message.</li>
</ul>

## Built with
VS Code with Live Server extention installed.

## Which technologies have been used?
<ul>
  <li> Bootstrap </li>
  <li> CSS3 </li>
  <li> HTML 5 </li>
</ul>

## Existing Features 
<ul>
  <li> About Me - Allows users to read a little about me as an individual without having to contact me first </li>
  <li> Resume - Allows users to view and download my resume in a PDF format. Also links users to my GitHub profile. Both of these open in a new tab to allow the user to switch back to the website at any time.</li>
  <li> Contact Me - Allows users to complete a form and click "submit" to send me a message.</li>
</ul>

## Future Development 
<ul>
  <li> I want to be able to add a portfolio page which will showcase any other sites I have created </li>
  <li> I want to be able to complete my contact me page with Python to enable form submission </li>
  <li> I may merge all seperate pages into one, scrollable page </li>
  <li> I want to create a blog page which details where I have been working, what I have been working on and any ideas which I wish to develop further and why </li>
</ul>

## Testing
<ol>
  <li> @media queries - I had a few issues with my site scaling as I had used the position:fixed element for most of the web layout. I managed to overcome this by using the transform:translate() element and the top: left: right: bottom: elements. Next time I would like to explore either using flexbox or Bootstrap classes e.g. "c-12" to prevent any scaling issues. </li>
  <li> After running my code through W3C it highlighted that I hadn't included any "alt:" attributes within my "img" tags. I added these and no futher issues were flagged. </li>
  <li> As I pulled code from Bootstrap for my Contact Form I needed to re-purpose it into performing the function I needed. I ended up changing the 3rd field into a text-area for now, only making the name and email address fields mandatory. I will explore setting rules for minimum character count within the "message" field later on. </li>
  <li>In the interest of time I wanted to ensure that everything on the site functioned correctly whilst following the user centered design process. I ran multiple tests across all viewports to ensure that all links worked correctly and provided visible feedback when clicked/hovered over. I also designed the site to follow consistent design principles, hence the navigation bars appearing at the top of the screen and the navigation pills being highlighted when viewing the relevant page.</li>
  <li>I began to look into .php to make my contact form work however, again as time constraints were tight I've left this to be completed outside of the milestone project. I may potentially use Python rather than .php. As the form doesn't submit currently, I added an alert banner to the Contact.html page to explain it's only to demonstrate HTML and CSS knowledge.</li>
</ol>

## Deployment
<ul>
  <li>I plan on hosting this site via 123-reg.co.uk to URL: www.annamorrison.co.uk</li>
  <li>All changes and amendments will be completed via VS Code, uploaded to GitHub and then pushed to my hosting provider.</li>
  <li>Version control will always be maintained via GitHub.</li>
