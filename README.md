## Why did I create this project?
<ul>
  <li>To enable potential employers and recruiters to see what I can bring to the table. They can see both and online copy and download my CV, read a little about who I am as an individual and contact me if they want to work together.</li>
  <li>I have optimised this project for web browser viewing as I believe my target dynamic would typically view this site on a laptop or a desktop PC. </li>
  <li>I've also connected my GitHub profile to ensure that my target dynamic can view any other repositories that I have worked on/am working on. </li>
</ul>

## Which technologies have been used?
<ul>
  <li> Bootstrap </li>
  <li> CSS3 </li>
  <li> HTML 5 </li>
</ul>

## Future Development 
<ul>
  <li> I want to be able to add a portfolio page which will showcase any other sites I have created </li>
  <li> I want to be able to complete my contact me page with Python to enable form submission </li>
  <li> I may merge all seperate pages into one, scrollable page </li>
  <li> I want to create a blog page which details where I have been working, what I have been working on and any ideas which I wish to develop further and why </li>
</ul>
