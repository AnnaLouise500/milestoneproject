# "Anna Morrison // Full Stack Developer"

## Why did I create this project?
<ul>
  <li>To enable potential employers and recruiters to see what I can bring to the table. They can see both and online copy and download my CV, read a little about who I am as an individual and contact me if they want to work together.</li>
  <li>I have optimised this project for web browser viewing as I believe my target dynamic would typically view this site on a laptop or a desktop PC. </li>
  <li>I've also connected my GitHub profile to ensure that my target dynamic can view any repositories that I have worked on/am working on. </li>
</ul>

## Built with
